# Sock
A Slack app for Mac.

## Why Sock?
- It may save you up to 66% on energy usage over the official Slack app, as it did for one user who tracked it for a day.
- It's free and open source.
- It's built on `WKWebView`, not Electron. As SwiftOnSecurity [says](https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1069777486471487490), "Electron is a cancer murdering both macOS and Windows as it proliferates."

## Installation
1. Open `Sock.xcodeproj`
2. Select **Product** > **Archive** in Xcode
3. In the Archives window, click **Distribute App**.
4. In the dialog that appears, select **Copy App** and click **Next**.
5. Choose a location to save the app. (Suggestion: `~/Applications`)
